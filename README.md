# 🤖 Building Effective Agents — Pattern Demos with LangGraph & CrewAI

This repository demonstrates core design patterns from the [Building Effective Agents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHCDrAbH_go&t=5s) series using two different frameworks:

- [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows)
- [CrewAI](https://crewai.io/)

The patterns are inspired by the course materials from [DeepLearning.AI’s AI Agents in LangGraph](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-agents-in-langgraph/) and this [workflow summary](https://mirror-feeling-d80.notion.site/Workflow-And-Agents-17e808527b1780d792a0d934ce62bee6).
